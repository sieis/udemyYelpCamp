Hark! It is my first "real" gitHub project. I coded along locally with all of this whilst working through Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. He dabbled with Git further into the course and especially to setup the Heroku link, but I've only at the end of the course finally setup the connection and pushed everything to my gitHub account.
